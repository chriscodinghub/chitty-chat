## Welcome to my chitty-chat!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.

+ I learned how to format models using No SQL.
+ I learned how to create and utilize databases using mongoose.
+ I learned how to test and confirm API routes via Insomnia.

## Functions of my App
+ This app is backEnd functioning only.
+ When you open the terminal start by entering 'node --watch index.js'
+ Then you will have a local server hosted at http://localhost:3001/
+ Now you will be able to use insomnia to preform the following actions:
+ Then you will be able to GET all, Get by ID, POST, PUT and Delete Users,
+ Next you will be able to POST to add a friend by ID and Delete a friend by ID,
+ Next you will be able to GET all, Get by ID, POST, PUT and Delete Thoughts
+ Lastly you will be able to POST and Delete Reactions which are subdocuments of Thoughts

## API routes
### User API routes
+ api/users
+ api/users/:userId
+ api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`

### Thought API routes
+ api/thought
+ api/thought/:thoughtId
### Reactions API routes
+ api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions
+ api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionsId
